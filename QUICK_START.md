# Quick Start Guide - VEX V5 Brain ↔ ESP32 Bidirectional System

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Configure ESP32 Code
Edit `ESP32-Bidirectional/src/main.cpp`:
```cpp
const char* WIFI_SSID = "YourWiFiName";        // Line 20
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword";     // Line 21
const float CALIBRATION_FACTOR = 106.53;        // Line 35 - Use your value
```

### 2. Upload Code
**VEX Brain:**
- Open `vex_brain_bidirectional.v5cpp` in VEXcode V5
- Download to VEX Brain

**ESP32:**
```bash
cd ESP32-Bidirectional
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

### 3. Connect Hardware
- Wire the MAX485 module to the ESP32 as per `WIRING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Connect VEX Smart Port 21 directly to RS-485 bus (Pin 3→A, Pin 4→B)
- Ensure common ground between VEX Pin 2 and ESP32 GND
- Connect HX711 load cell to ESP32
- Power both systems

### 4. Verify Operation
- ✓ VEX screen shows "VEX V5 <-> ESP32 Bridge"
- ✓ ESP32 Serial shows "System ready - entering main loop"
- ✓ Load cell weight appears on VEX screen
- ✓ VEX battery data appears in ESP32 Serial

## 📡 MQTT Topics

Subscribe to these on your MQTT client:

```
ESP32/loadCell/weight          → Weight in kg (float)
ESP32/vexBrain/battery         → Battery % (float)
ESP32/vexBrain/temperature     → Temperature °C (float)
ESP32/vexBrain/status          → Combined status (string)
```

**Test with mosquitto_sub:**
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h broker.hivemq.com -t "ESP32/#" -v
```

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### No RS-485 Communication
1. **Swap A and B wires** (most common issue!)
2. Ensure common ground between VEX Pin 2 and ESP32 GND
3. Check baud rate is 115200 on both sides
4. Verify MAX485 module has power

### No Load Cell Data
1. Check HX711 wiring (DOUT→GPIO25, SCK→GPIO26)
2. Verify load cell wire colors match HX711 terminals
3. Run ESP32 serial monitor to see if load cell initialized

### No WiFi Connection
1. Check SSID and password in code
2. Ensure WiFi is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
3. Move ESP32 closer to router

### MQTT Not Publishing
1. Verify WiFi is connected first (ESP32 Serial: "WiFi connected")
2. Check MQTT broker is accessible
3. Try public broker: `broker.hivemq.com`

## 📝 Message Protocol

### VEX → ESP32
```
<BRAIN|time|battery%|voltage|current|temp>
Example: <BRAIN|45.23|87.5|12.45|1.23|32.1>
```

### ESP32 → VEX
```
<WEIGHT|kg_value>
Example: <WEIGHT|12.45>

<STATUS|message>
Example: <STATUS|MQTT Connected>
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### ESP32 Serial Output
```bash
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

Look for:
- `WiFi connected` - WiFi OK
- `MQTT broker set to: ...` - MQTT config OK
- `Load cell initialized and tared successfully` - Load cell OK
- `Received from VEX: BRAIN|...` - RS-485 receiving OK
- `Published weight: X.XX kg` - MQTT publishing OK

### VEX Brain Screen
Should display:
```
Line 1: VEX V5 <-> ESP32 Bridge
Line 2: Port 21 @ 115200 baud
Line 4: TX to ESP32:
Line 5: Batt:XX% Temp:XX.XC
Line 7: RX from ESP32:
Line 8: (Status messages)
Line 10: Load Cell Weight:
Line 11: XX.XX kg
```

## ⏱️ Timing Reference

| Operation | Frequency | Adjustable Constant |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| VEX sends to ESP32 | 1/sec | `SEND_INTERVAL_MS` |
| ESP32 reads load cell | 20/sec | `WEIGHT_READ_INTERVAL` |
| ESP32 publishes MQTT | 1/sec | `MQTT_PUBLISH_INTERVAL` |
| RS-485 polling | 50/sec | `RS485_READ_INTERVAL` |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **Power On**: Both systems initialize, ESP32 connects to WiFi/MQTT
2. **VEX → ESP32**: VEX sends battery data every 1 second
3. **ESP32 → VEX**: ESP32 sends weight data every 50ms
4. **ESP32 → MQTT**: All data published every 1 second
5. **VEX Display**: Shows sent data, received weight, and status
6. **ESP32 Serial**: Shows detailed debug information

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Start Simple**: Test RS-485 with short cable first (<3 feet)
- **Monitor Both**: Keep VEX screen and ESP32 Serial visible
- **Check Basics**: Power, baud rate, A/B wiring are most common issues
- **Use MQTT Explorer**: Great visual tool for monitoring MQTT topics
- **Calibrate Load Cell**: Run HX711 calibration sketch before using this system
